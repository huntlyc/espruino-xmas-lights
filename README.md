Espurino Xmas lights
====================

Simple hack and slash of battery light string. [Here are the ones used to produce this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B017OTTF50/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=10)

## Basic Build
The example link above is a 3 AA battery powered string with resistor limiting the circuit voltage to just over 3v.  Figure out the positive and negative leads (in this case, the negative lead had the resistor on it) and hook them into A1 and GND ports on the Espurino.

## Features
Pushing the on board button on the Espurino will cycle the modes.  The modes are:
1. A cycled pattern.
2. Steady blink
3. Random light on duration with a 200ms off durationn.
